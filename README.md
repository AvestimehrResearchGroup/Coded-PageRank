# MapReduce based PageRank

We implement the PageRank algorithm in the MapReduce framework. Our goal is to demonstrate how coding theoretic strageties can be utilized for speeding up PageRank like iterative algorithms. The ideas utilized in these codes have been developed in our recent work which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05522
